In the Project folder "modules" you have the grpc folder, and there is a "writer.py" that you can run once you have the gRPC server running.

To make a sample request to the gRPC server, please have a look in the file in the modules folder.
modules/lcoation_grpc/writer.py
Please modify the values in this file and execute it.

This will send request to the gRPC server which has been deployed into kubernetes and it is up and running.
